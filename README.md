<h2>Sutton Pyton Examples</h2>

<h3>By me.</h3>

<p>Here I share my code for Sutton's Introduction to Reinforcement Learning.
All code is written for Python 3.x, dependencies include NumPy, Matplodlib etc.</p>

<p>I try to avoid specific ML and RL frameworks, because my goal is to understand algorithms, not just use them.</p>

<p>Code might be messy, I am working on it. Feel free to commit!</p>
